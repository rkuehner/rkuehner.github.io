    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="overview">
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>There are many cloud storage services already on the market, each with its own set of features and strengths. One thing these services have in common, however, is a lack of options when it comes to organization. These inadequate controls over how users can save, display, and search for their files is a major cause of frustration. In addition, people are saving content from the web in a different location from where their personal files are saved. Together this leads to disorganization and difficulty for users to locate their files when they need them.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Pouch delivers a clean, intuitive design that allows users to save their content the way they want. Increased options for organization include sorting files into a custom order, viewing favorite files within a folder, and a tagging feature for easy searchability. Pouch also makes it convenient to save web links right in the app, so personal files and web content is now stored all in one place</p>

    <!-- RESEARCH & DISCOVERY -->
    <section class="research">
      <h1>Research & Discovery</h1>
      <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
      <p>To see how Pouch could fit into the market, I chose to do a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest. Google Drive and Dropbox, both extremely popular apps for cloud storage, excel in terms of backing up files, sharing, and collaboration. However, I found that they both lack when it comes to 1) organization options and 2) the ability to easily save links to websites. Pinterest, in contrast, is completely focused on organization and saving web content, but is not a place to backup personal files or create documents.</p>
      <p>What I discovered is there is need for an app that combines the functionality of traditional cloud storage services, like Dropbox and Google Drive, with the increased organization options and ability to easily save web content, like Pinterest.</p>
      <h2>User survey</h2>
      <p>I wanted to understand what applications people are currently using for cloud storage, what they expect from their applications, and what frustrations they may have. I learned many key findings based on these results. It also confirmed that I was correct in my observation that a lack of organization options is a cause of frustration and needs improvement.</p>

      <ul class="survey-results">
        <li>92% of people use cloud storage, with Google Drive and Dropbox being the most popular</li>
        <li>The two most important features are accessing files from any device and backing up their files</li>
        <li>The two biggest frustrations are not enough options for organizing files and the difficulty to find files</li>
        <li>69.6% of people save web content with browser bookmarks</li>
        <li>91.3% of users would like the ability to organize their files in a custom order</li>
        <li>69.6% of cloud storage users would like a tagging feature</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Mariah L.</h3>
        <h4>26 | Photographer | Brooklyn, NY</h4>
        <h5>Motivations</h5>
        <p>Mariah requires a lot of storage space to backup all of her photographs, and with so many files to sort through, she would love more options for organization. She also struggles to locate files and is hoping for a better solution. Mariah realizes that she will need to pay for the amount of storage space she needs, but as a young photographer living in the expensive NYC area she is hoping to keep this cost as low as possible.</p>
        <h5>Frustrations</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Can't find her files</li>
          <li>Doesn't like the look and feel of other cloud storage interfaces</li>
          <li>It's expensive to pay for all the storage space she needs</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section class="ia">
      <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
      <h2>User stories & flows</h2>
      <p>Based on all of the research I had done, I created user stories to detail what features would be included and to prioritize those features. These user stories were then turned into flows to understand how the user would move through the application.</p>

      <!-- BRANDING -->
      <section class="branding">
        <h1>Branding</h1>
        <p>When deciding on the overall look and feel of the brand, I thought about who my users are. Based on my research, I knew that cloud storage is used for both personal and professional use, and I had received feedback that many people did not like the look of the applications they currently used. I decided the branding for Pouch would be playful and fun, while still remaining professional. I then began working on the logo, color palette, and typography.</p>
        <a href="url">View Style Guide</a>  <!-- CREATE LINK!! -->

        <h2>Colors</h2>
        <p>Pouch’s color palette consists of turquoise blues and orange that evoke the fun look I was going for. These complimentary colors work well together, and orange is a vibrant color used for call to action buttons. I kept the color palette from becoming too bright and overwhelming and with muted tones and shades of gray.</p>
        <img class="colors" src="images/pouch/colors.svg" alt="Pouch Colors">

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Sansita One and Poppins work well with the logo and other elements used in the design as they all contain soft, rounded edges for a cohesive look. Sansita One is used sparingly on headings, while Poppins is used for most elements throughout the application. Poppins has a sense of friendliness and has high legibility and many font weights to choose from.</p>

        <h2>Logo</h2>
        <p>The logo for Pouch is a kangaroo. This logo represents Pouch as a safe place to store what’s most important, similarly to how a kangaroo uses its pouch.</p>

        <h1>Wireframes & Testing</h1>
        <img src="images/pouch/sketches.jpg" alt="Sketches">
        <h2>Sketches & wireframes</h2>
        <p>With user stories, user flows, and a sitemap complete, I was able to use these as direction for creating sketches and wireframes to see the functionality of the app, determine a hierarchy of information, and create a grid structure. Once completed, the wireframes were turned into a clickable prototype on InVision for testing.</p>

          <p>In my original design, recent files were listed above the rest of the files. After testing, a separate recent files tab was created to clear up space on the dashboard.</p>

        <div class="test">
          <img src="images/pouch/test2.png" alt="Folder change from testing">
          <p>When creating a folder it wasn’t clear to users that they could click on a folder to change its color. A colored drop with a down arrow next to the folder icon was added and immediately resolved this issue.</p>

      <!-- FINAL DESGIN -->
      <section class="final">
        <p>After putting all that research, testing, and branding work together, Pouch delivers a clean and friendly design for for saving files, creating documents, and sharing and collaborating on content. Everything that a user needs to save, both personal files and web links, can be saved together in one place, and these files can then be found more easily through tagging and custom organization features. </p>

      <!-- CONCLUSION -->
      <section class="conclusion">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>At the start of this project I had doubts about how I would create a product that successfully differentiates itself in the market of cloud storage, given how many services already exist and how popular applications like Google Drive are. Based on my own experiences, I felt one area that could vastly use improvement was organization features, and it was through the process of conducting user surveys and testing that I discovered others felt exactly the same way.</p>
        <h5>Lessons learned</h5>
        <p>One major takeaway I had while working on Pouch was just how crucial user testing and the feedback I received was. In addition to providing a focus for my application, this feedback dictated changes through every iteration. From big changes like the navigation of the app, to smaller changes like the colors of the buttons, I used this feedback to continually improve my design. I also realized that features that might make sense to me, the designer who already knows how the application works, might not be clear to others unfamiliar with the project. One example of this was when it wasn’t obvious the color of a folder could be changed by clicking on its icon. It was only after testing and getting insight from potential users that I was able to see the problem and provide a solution to fix it.</p>
