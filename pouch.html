          <h2 class="sub-section">Problem</h2>
          <p class="paragraph gap">There are many cloud storage services already on the market, each with its own set of features and strengths. One thing these services have in common, however, is a lack of options when it comes to organization. These inadequate controls over how users can save, display, and search for their files is a major cause of frustration. In addition, people are saving content from the web in a different location from where their personal files are saved. Together this leads to disorganization and difficulty for users to locate their files when they need them.</p>
          <h2 class="sub-section">Solution</h2>
          <p class="paragraph gap">Pouch delivers a clean, intuitive design that allows users to save their content the way they want. Increased options for organization include sorting files into a custom order, viewing favorite files within a folder, and a tagging feature for easy searchability. Pouch also makes it convenient to save web links right in the app, so personal files and web content is now stored all in one place</p>

        <h2 class="sub-section">Competitive analysis</h2>
        <p class="paragraph space-below">To see how Pouch could fit into the market, I chose to do a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest. Google Drive and Dropbox, both extremely popular apps for cloud storage, excel in terms of backing up files, sharing, and collaboration. However, I found that they both lack when it comes to 1) organization options and 2) the ability to easily save links to websites. Pinterest, in contrast, is completely focused on organization and saving web content, but is not a place to backup personal files or create documents.</p>
        <p class="paragraph gap">What I discovered is there is need for an app that combines the functionality of traditional cloud storage services, like Dropbox and Google Drive, with the increased organization options and ability to easily save web content, like Pinterest.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-section">User survey</h2>
        <p class="paragraph space-below">I wanted to understand what applications people are currently using for cloud storage, what they expect from their applications, and what frustrations they may have. I learned many key findings based on these results. It also confirmed that I was correct in my observation that a lack of organization options is a cause of frustration and needs improvement.</p>

I decided the branding for Pouch would be playful and fun, while still remaining professional. I then began working on the logo, color palette, and typography.</p>

        <h1 class="new-section">Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="container container-inner">
          <p class="paragraph space-below">At the start of this project I had doubts about how I would create a product that successfully differentiates itself in the market of cloud storage, given how many services already exist and how popular applications like Google Drive are. Based on my own experiences, I felt one area that could vastly use improvement was organization features, and it was through the process of conducting user surveys and testing that I discovered others felt exactly the same way.</p>
          <h5 class="small-title">Lessons learned</h5>
          <p class="paragraph page-bottom">One major takeaway I had while working on Pouch was just how crucial user testing and the feedback I received was. In addition to providing a focus for my application, this feedback dictated changes through every iteration. From big changes like the navigation of the app, to smaller changes like the colors of the buttons, I used this feedback to continually improve my design. I also realized that features that might make sense to me, someone who already knows how the application works, might not be clear to others unfamiliar with the project. One example of this was when it wasn’t obvious the color of a folder could be changed by clicking on its icon. It was only after testing and getting insight from potential users that I was able to see the problem and provide a solution to fix it.</p>
